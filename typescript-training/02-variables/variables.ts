let found: boolean = true;
// let <name>: type = initial value;
// instead var keyword using by JS, let keyword eliminates some pitfalls

let grade: number = 99.6;
let firstName: string = "Matt";

//any keyword. assign this varriable to any type, this loses type safty, only uses this for generics

console.log(found);
console.log("the grade is " + grade);
console.log("The first name is "+firstName);
//or using backticks without concatanations
console.log(`The name is ${firstName}`);
